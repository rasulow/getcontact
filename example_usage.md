# Updated Contact Creation Logic

## How it works now:

The system now allows the same fullname with different phone numbers, but prevents duplicate combinations of fullname + phone_number.

## Example scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Same fullname, different phone numbers - ALLOWED
```json
POST /contacts/
[
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+1234567890"},
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+0987654321"}
]
```
**Result**: Both contacts will be created successfully because they have different phone numbers.

### Scenario 2: Same fullname, same phone number - SKIPPED
```json
POST /contacts/
[
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+1234567890"},
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+1234567890"}
]
```
**Result**: Only one contact will be created, the second one will be skipped.

### Scenario 3: Mixed scenario
```json
POST /contacts/
[
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+1234567890"},    // New
  {"fullname": "Jane Smith", "phone_number": "+0987654321"},  // New  
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+1234567890"},    // Duplicate - skipped
  {"fullname": "John Doe", "phone_number": "+5555555555"}     // New (different phone)
]
```
**Result**: 
- Created: 3 contacts (John Doe with +1234567890, Jane Smith with +0987654321, John Doe with +5555555555)
- Skipped: 1 contact (John Doe with +1234567890 - duplicate)

## Response format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Successfully created 3 new contacts, skipped 1 existing combinations",
  "total_requested": 4,
  "created_count": 3,
  "skipped_count": 1,
  "created_data": [
    // Array of successfully created contacts
  ],
  "skipped_data": [
    {
      "fullname": "John Doe",
      "phone_number": "+1234567890",
      "reason": "Contact with same fullname and phone number already exists"
    }
  ]
}
```
